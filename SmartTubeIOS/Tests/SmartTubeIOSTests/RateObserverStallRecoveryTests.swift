// MARK: - RateObserverStallRecoveryTests
//
// Structural tests for the rateObserver stall recovery added in task #100.
//
// The recovery logic in PlaybackViewModel+Observers.swift mirrors the
// AVPlayerItemPlaybackStalled path from PlaybackViewModel+Loading.swift.
// Both paths must share the same cap (3 attempts) and the same guard semantics.
// These tests document and guard those invariants at the constants/logic level.
