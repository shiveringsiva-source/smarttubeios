## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milika/SmartTubeIOS
cd SmartTubeIOS
open SmartTube.xcworkspace
```

### Signing

The project requires an Apple Developer Team ID and a Firebase `GoogleService-Info.plist` to build.  
Copy `SmartTubeApp/Config/Secrets.xcconfig.example` to `SmartTubeApp/Config/Secrets.xcconfig` and fill in your Team ID:

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID
SMARTTUBE_TV_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

Add your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `SmartTubeApp/SmartTubeApp/` (create a free Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) — only Analytics and Crashlytics are used).  
Both files are gitignored and will never be committed.

Pull requests are welcome. See [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for the checklist.  
Please ensure `Secrets.xcconfig` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` are **never** included in a PR.
