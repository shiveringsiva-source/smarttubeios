// MARK: - PlayerDoubleTapUITests
//
// UI tests for the zone-based double-tap gesture on PlayerView (iOS only).
//
// The player surface is divided into three horizontal zones:
//   Left  1/3 — double-tap seeks backward  (seekBackSeconds)
//   Middle 1/3 — double-tap toggles Fit / Fill video gravity
//   Right 1/3 — double-tap seeks forward   (seekForwardSeconds)
//
// Each test opens a fixed video via deep-link (bypassing the Home feed), waits
// for the controls overlay to auto-hide, performs a double-tap in the target
// zone, and asserts that the self-dismissing toast appears in the accessibility tree.
//
// Requirements:
//   • Network access (YouTube must serve dQw4w9WgXcQ).
//   • Run on an iOS 17+ simulator with the SmartTube scheme.
