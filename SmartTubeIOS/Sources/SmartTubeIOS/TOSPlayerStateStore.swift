// MARK: - TOSPlayerStateStore
//
// iOS equivalent of PlayerStateStore, but for the WKWebView-backed TOS player.
// Owns TOSPlayerViewModel (and its WKWebView) so it survives TOSPlayerView
// dismiss/re-present cycles — enabling mini-player audio continuity.
//
// Presentation state:
//   .hidden     — no video loaded, WKWebView released
//   .miniPlayer — audio continues in TOSMiniPlayerView, TOSPlayerView dismissed
//   .fullScreen — TOSPlayerView presented as a full-screen cover
//
// Lifecycle:
//   play(video:api:)  → create/reload vm, set .fullScreen
//   minimize()        → set .miniPlayer (vm/WKWebView kept alive, audio continues)
//   expand()          → set .fullScreen (re-present TOSPlayerView)
//   stop()            → vm.pause() + vm.saveProgress(), release vm, set .hidden
