// MARK: - Watch History / Position Checkpointing
//
// Parity fix: the standard PlaybackViewModel begins a WatchtimeTracker session via
// tracker.transition(...) from load(), resolves account-bound tracking URLs, and
// checkpoints the watch position from suspend()/stop() — both of which fire from
// the player view's onDisappear (see PlayerView+Lifecycle.swift). Before this change
// TOSPlayerViewModel did none of this: closing a TOS-played video silently lost the
// watch position (resume-from-last-position was a one-shot read at startup, never
// written back) and TOS sessions never appeared in "continue watching"/history.
//
// Lifecycle here (simpler than the standard player's, since each TOSPlayerViewModel
// instance is scoped to exactly one video — there is no in-place video switch):
//   "ready"      → beginWatchtimeTracking(): tracker.transition(...) opens the
//                  session (the returned flush closure is a no-op — no prior video
//                  in this instance's lifetime), then resolves cached tracking URLs.
//   onDisappear  → saveProgress(): single checkpoint with the final position/duration,
//                  mirroring stop()'s "save on close" semantics.

        // `self` would otherwise be released the instant the view disappears. Capturing
