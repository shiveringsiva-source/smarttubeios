// After every run of testTOSPlayerAutoSkipsSponsorSegment, load

// Classify every skip before closing the task:
//
// LEGITIMATE skip:
//   - "No video cards found" / "No non-short video card found" — home feed network
//     unavailable in the simulator. Device log should show NO "[SponsorBlock] UI-TEST
//     INJECT" line (the player was never opened).
//   - "onPlayerReady never fired" — IFrame embed failed to load (network/YouTube
//     availability), unrelated to the SponsorBlock code path under test. Device log
//     should show "[ytCallback] ❌ player error" or no "ready" notice.
//
// BUG skip (must fix before closing):
//   - The "auto-skip did not trigger" XCTAssertEqual failure path — that's a hard
//     failure, not a skip, but treat it identically: investigate before closing.
//   - Any skip reached AFTER "[TOS-sponsorskip] ✓ ready" prints in the test's stdout —
//     by that point the synthetic segment was injected and the only remaining work is
//     the auto-skip path itself, so a skip there means that path broke.
//
// Log events to verify (grep for "[SponsorBlock]"):
//   ✓ "[SponsorBlock] UI-TEST INJECT — bypassing cache/network, applied 1 synthetic
//      segment(s): sponsor[2.0–6.0s]"          — injection seam fired with the right spec
//   ✓ "[SponsorBlock] skip TRIGGER category=sponsor action=skip segment=[2.0s–6.0s]
//      ... before=Xs target=6.00s"             — trigger logged; "before" should read ≈2s

//      (target was 6.00s, Δtarget=...)"        — landing confirmed; "after" should read

//
// RED FLAGS in device log:
//   - ZERO "[SponsorBlock]" lines at all → fetchSponsorSegments returned at its first
//     guard (sponsorBlockEnabled / activeSponsorCategories). Most likely cause: settings
//     persisted to UserDefaults from a PRIOR launch — e.g. the smoke test above runs
//     first with --uitesting-disable-sponsorblock, which SAVES sponsorBlockEnabled=false
//     (see SettingsStore.save()/init()). This bit the very first run of this test —
//     confirm "--uitesting-reset-settings" is still present in this test's launchArguments
//     (it restores AppSettings() defaults before the injection arg is read) before
//     looking anywhere else.
//   - "[SponsorBlock] skip TIMEOUT" → seek fired but currentTime never caught up —
//     investigate seekTo()/the JS bridge, not the logging itself
//   - A second "[SponsorBlock] skip TRIGGER category=sponsor" for the SAME [2.0–6.0s]
//     segment → activeSkipEnd re-entry guard regressed
//   - "skip TRIGGER" present with no matching "skip LANDED"/"skip TIMEOUT" before the
//     log ends → logSkipLanding wiring in the "tick" handler is broken
//   - "[SponsorBlock] toast SHOW" for category=sponsor → settings.sponsorAction
//     defaulted to showToast instead of skip (defaults changed or didn't apply)

// MARK: - TOSPlayerUITests
//
// Smoke test for the macOS IFrame (TOS-compliant) player.
//
// What it verifies:
//   1. Tapping the first non-short video card opens the TOS player (tosPlayer.stateLabel visible —
//      TOSPlayerView has no on-screen back/close button, see its body's doc comment for why).
//   2. The IFrame player starts playing within 30 s (Darwin notification fires + AX state = "playing").
//   3. No crash / stateLabel disappearance during 5 s of playback.
//   4. Pressing Esc dismisses the player (stateLabel disappears) — the only dismissal path.
//
// Preconditions:
//   - useTOSPlayerOnMac defaults to true on macOS (AppSettings.swift).
//   - The test passes --uitesting-disable-sponsorblock to avoid SponsorBlock skips
//     interfering with the simple "is it playing?" assertion.
//
// Lifecycle note: each test launches its OWN XCUIApplication instance exactly once
// via launchApp(extraArguments:) — mirroring HideShortsHomeUITests' launch(hideShorts:)
// (same minimal shape: fresh XCUIApplication, ["--uitesting", ...extra], app.launch(),
// nothing else). There is NO app launch in setUpWithError. This is deliberate: an
// earlier version of testTOSPlayerAutoSkipsSponsorSegment launched once in setUp and
// then did app.terminate() + a second XCUIApplication().launch() mid-test, which
// triggered a DETERMINISTIC auth-state race — the second back-to-back launch
// consistently hung after "Multilogin HTTP 403 INVALID_TOKENS" and never reached
// [Browse]/[Home]/[InnerTube] (reproduced identically twice). A single fresh launch
// per test does not hit this race. Do not reintroduce a mid-test terminate+relaunch.
//
// IMPORTANT — do NOT add saved-application-state deletion or
// "-ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES" to launchApp. An earlier revision did both
// (to "always open a fresh window"), and that combination, ONLY when paired with
// "--uitesting-reset-settings + at least one more --uitesting-* argument", caused a
// ~100% reproducible hang during auth/home-feed bootstrap — the app got stuck right
// after "Multilogin HTTP 403 INVALID_TOKENS" and never logged [Browse]/[InnerTube]
// setAuthToken/[Home], so "No video cards found" fired at the 41s mark and the test
// SKIPPED. Proven via 11 controlled diagnostics: neither flag content, ordering, nor
// SettingsStore-recognition explained it — swapping in HideShortsHomeUITests' EXACT
// passing args (--uitesting-reset-settings --uitesting-hide-shorts) through the
// persistence-wiping launchApp reproduced the identical hang, while the same args
// through HideShortsHomeUITests' minimal launch() pass reliably. The wipe machinery
// is unnecessary anyway — XCUIApplication already opens a fresh window per launch in
// this single-launch-per-test architecture (confirmed: smoke test passes without it).
