import XCTest

// MARK: - AirPlayUITests
//
// UI tests for AirPlay support in the SmartTube player.
//
// What's tested:
//   • The AirPlay button (player.airPlayButton) is visible in the player controls overlay.
//   • Tapping the button opens the route picker sheet without crashing.
//   • The button is visible alongside (not replacing) the PiP button.
//
// What cannot be tested on simulator:
//   • Actual AirPlay routing — requires a physical AirPlay-compatible device on the same network.
//   • The "Playing on Apple TV" indicator — only fires when a real AirPlay session is active.
//
// Network is required to open the player from the Home feed.
// Tests skip gracefully when the feed is empty or the player fails to open.
