// MARK: - AudioGhostStreamRegressionUITests
//
// Regression tests for the audio-duplication / ghost-stream bug.
//
// Root causes fixed (May 2026):
//   1. MPRemoteCommandCenter – `addTarget` was never balanced with `removeTarget`.
//      Ghost VMs responded to lock screen "Play", re-starting audio alongside the
//      active player.  Fix: `suspend()` and `stop()` now call `removeAllTargets()`;
//      `resume()` and `loadAsync()` re-register via `setupRemoteCommandCenter()`.
//
//   2. ShortsPlayerView – had no `scenePhase` observer, so `handleBackground()` /
//      `handleForeground()` were never called; locking the phone left audio in an
//      undefined state for Shorts.  Fix: `.onChange(of: scenePhase)` added.
//
//   3. ShortsPlayerView.onAppear – unconditionally called `loadVideo(at:)`, causing
//      a full reload (and transient double-audio) on every spurious appear (e.g. after
//      navigating to a channel and coming back).  Fix: idempotency guard matching
//      PlayerView's pattern.
//
//   4. audioSessionObserver – never removed, so stopped VMs responded to
//      interruption-ended notifications and could restart their player.
//      Fix: observer removed in `stop()` and `deinit`.
//
// Requirements:
//   • Network access is required for most tests.
//   • Run on an iOS 17+ simulator with the SmartTubeApp scheme selected.
//   • Launch args: --uitesting  (disables animations; adds --uitesting-enable-shorts
//     where Shorts access is required).
